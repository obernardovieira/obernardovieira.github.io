I'm a full stack software developer with focus on solidity and typescript/rust backend. 6 years ago, I started my journey at a blockchain studio, building a diverse list of projects. After that, co-founded impactMarket and grew it to a team of 15+, with 50k+ users.

Curious, ambitious and commited to the potential of blockchain, I'm looking to connect and discuss ideas!

Currently learning about Zero Knowledge.
