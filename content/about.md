I'm a full stack software developer with focus on solidity and typescript/rust backend. 6 years ago, I started my journey at a blockchain studio, building a diverse list of projects. After that, co-founded impactMarket and grew it to a team of 15+, with 50k+ users.

Curious, ambitious and commited to the potential of blockchain, I'm looking to connect and discuss ideas!

Currently learning about Zero Knowledge.


> “Eat at a local restaurant tonight. Get the cream sauce. Have a cold pint at 4 o’clock in a mostly empty bar. Go somewhere you’ve never been. Listen to someone you think may have nothing in common with you. Order the steak rare. Eat an oyster. Have a negroni. Have two. Be open to a world where you may not understand or agree with the person next to you, but have a drink with them anyways. Eat slowly. Tip your server. Check in on your friends. Check in on yourself. Enjoy the ride.”
